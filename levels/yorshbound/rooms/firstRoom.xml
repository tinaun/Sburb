<!-- the completed first room
     any sprite that has an action associated with it is clickable. the name is what text appears in the yellow boxes when you
	 click on them, and the args are a more detailed descripton that pops up after. if you don't want anything to be clickable,
	 leave the text alone and i'll remove it.               tinaun -->

   <!-- here we're adding in our BG and FG. This is the second half of our 
   optimization. To avoid creating a dozen sprites for every single tile, we
   specify that this image has been sliced up into tiles. Then we just specify
   how many there are and how big they are, and the system will find all of them
   and tile them correctly based on their names. This also makes it very easy
   to transition from using one big image to a sliced up one. -->
